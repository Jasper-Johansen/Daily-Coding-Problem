    "This problem is about minimizing the maximum distance any mouse needs to move to reach a hole. It is not about minimizing the individual distances for each mouse, but instead, ensuring that no mouse has to travel an excessively large distance compared to the others. Let me clarify with an explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we sort the mice and holes by their positions, we can pair them greedily from left to right.\n",
    "The reasoning is that, by sorting, the nearest holes for a set of mice are likely to be in sequential order, minimizing the largest step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to minimize the maximum distance any mouse needs to travel, which is achieved by pairing the nearest available hole to each mouse.\n",
    "Steps to Solve:\n",
    "1. Sort the mice's positions.\n",
    "2. Sort the holes' positions.\n",
    "3. Match the sorted mice and holes one by one, and calculate the distances for these pairings.\n",
    "4. Return the maximum distance from these pairings, as that represents the worst-case travel distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Solution:\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "Mice: <code>[1, 4, 9, 15]</code>\n",
    "Holes: <code>[10, -5, 0, 16]</code>\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "Sort the positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mice: <code>[1, 4, 9, 15]</code>\n",
    "Holes: <code>[-5, 0, 10, 16]</code>\n",
    "Pair the mice with the holes one by one:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mouse at 1 → Hole at -5 → Distance = |1 - (-5)| = 6\n",
    "Mouse at 4 → Hole at 0 → Distance = |4 - 0| = 4\n",
    "Mouse at 9 → Hole at 10 → Distance = |9 - 10| = 1\n",
    "Mouse at 15 → Hole at 16 → Distance = |15 - 16| = 1\n",
    "Maximum distance: 6\n",

    "A regular number in mathematics is defined as one which evenly divides some power of 60. Equivalently, we can say that a regular number is one whose only prime divisors are 2, 3, and 5.\n",

    "These numbers have had many applications, from helping ancient Babylonians keep time to tuning instruments according to the diatonic scale.\n",

    "Given an integer N, write a program that returns, in order, the first N regular numbers."
